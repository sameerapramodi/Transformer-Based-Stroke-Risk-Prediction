        "The code interacts with all the attributes (columns) in the dataset through several data preprocessing and modeling steps. Here's a breakdown of how the code interacts with the data's attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Loading the Data: The first interaction is loading the dataset from the specified file path into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "Initial Cleanup: The code drops specific columns (Patient ID, Patient Name) that are not relevant for the prediction task.\n",
        "Separating Attribute Types: Attributes are separated into numerical and categorical types to apply different preprocessing techniques.\n",
        "Handling Missing Values:\n",
        "For numerical attributes, missing values are imputed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputer, which estimates missing values based on the values of their nearest neighbors.\n",
        "For categorical attributes, missing values are filled with the mode (most frequent value) of each column.\n",
        "Feature Engineering: New attributes are created based on existing ones:\n",
        "Age_group is created by categorizing the Age attribute into bins.\n",
        "Hypertension_x_Age is created by multiplying the Hypertension and Age attributes.\n",
        "Encoding Categorical Attributes: Categorical attributes (including the newly engineered Age_group) are transformed into numerical representations using Target Encoding. This replaces each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",
        "Separating Features and Target: The target attribute (Diagnosis) is separated from the feature attributes (X) that will be used for training the models.\n",
        "Handling Class Imbalance: SMOTENC is applied to the features and target to create synthetic samples for the minority class. This is done before scaling, using the indices of the original categorical columns to guide the synthesis process.\n",
        "Scaling Features: The numerical feature attributes (which now include the encoded categorical features) are scaled using StandardScaler to have zero mean and unit variance. This is important for distance-based algorithms and can improve the performance of some models.\n",
        "Splitting Data: The scaled feature attributes and the resampled target attribute are split into training and testing sets.\n",
        "Model Training: The training data (including all preprocessed attributes) is used to train the CatBoost model and the Stacking Ensemble model.\n",
        "Model Evaluation: The trained models are used to make predictions on the test data, and the performance is evaluated using various metrics.\n",
        "In essence, the code interacts with all attributes by cleaning, transforming, and preparing them for use in the machine learning models. The specific interaction depends on whether an attribute is numerical or categorical and the stage of the pipeline."
